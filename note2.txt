 1.after saving this in vim deployment.yml

2.kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
3.kubectl get deploy
4.kubectl get pods
5.kubectl get rs     (rs is short form for replica set)

 iN both step 3 and 4 we could see the see the data ,so how pod is created .ie: when we apply deployment a replicaconcontroller creats the replicas of pods as much as required.
So even if we delete that pod it will create automatically as auto scaling
