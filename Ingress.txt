Ingress
 why we need ingress
 Earlier they were using loadbalancer with out ingress and faced maintwo issues
   1. Enterprices level features are missing   : 1.sticky nodes : (ie if a session using one ip then all the request from that user or session has to use same pod)
                      2:Ratio based request
                      3. TLS ...
   2. For each service the load balancer make has to pay to the cloud provider it was so heavy.
So the INGRESS came to picture


First to use ingress resourse we need a ingress controller

 Ingress controller is actually the load balancer we need it can be ngnix or anything,we need to go to theresite and ind how to use there ingress conroller 
oce we deploy the ingress controller

How to install Ingress controller : search in google Kubernetes ngnix ingress controller for minikube  ( we can use any provide ,not necessary its ngnix)  :It will givesmple stepsto install the container.
 

 we can write the ingress resorses according to our requirement for  pod or 2 pod ... path based or anything...
