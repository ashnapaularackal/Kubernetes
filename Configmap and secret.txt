Configmap and secret
 Config map is used to store the data which could be not sensitive and need to be used by the application or  pod .. 
This data will be stored in etcd then as objects it could get hacked by 
hackers

So we use to save sensitive data in secretes ,then the data will be encrypted at rest before storing to etcd ,
so even though hacker tries to hack ,could not hack since has no idea of decrypt code


To create a config map 
 first create a yml file vim cm.yml  by providing version port  any data we need to give  get the example  from website
 then apply it as kubectl apply -f cm.yml
  kubectl get cm   :to see the config map details

Lets say we have given name as test -cm 
 them to describe we use : kubectl describe cm test-cm   
    here we can see all the details we entered such as db port and all.


So we have the end goal to take this details as environment variable and use in our application.
   So in the deployment.yml file give  a enc section
    anywhere you can give
       env:
         name : db -port  ( in case we want to retrieve db port details)
         value from:
          configmapkeyref:
              name:   give name of config map here it is test map
              key:   give the name of port or data we need to retrieve like db- port given in cm.yml


after this see its applleied proplerly
then get pod using  kubectl get pod
 go inside any pod as  kubectl exec -it (name of pod) --/bin/bash
 then check env | grep BD
   we could see the port used.

Demerrit of this approach is if someone go and change the port this wont be reflexted in env we need to restart deployment which is not permissible might lead to traffic
 so the other approach we can use is :Volume mounts
  create a volume ( which is nothing but a storage ) in the deployment.yml file
  in the same level of container. in it give details of name and configmap
  then in the container instead of env give volumeMounts name and connection and nount path
  now if we execute the pod and check env | grep
  we could not see any data :since we removed it
  if go to the mount location we could see the port


Similarly we can create secret ,we can use kubectl create secreat generic  ....
if you check the secret describe or in edit we could see its in encryted form.
